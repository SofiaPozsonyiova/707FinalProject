The purpose of this GitHub page is to be a collaborative environment for a semester-long group project for the Fall 2022 BIOSTAT 707: Statistical Methods for Machine Learning at Duke University.  The group members, Sofia Pozsonyiova, Mairead Dillon, and Shannon Murphy, are Master of Biostatistics candidates graduating in the spring of 2023.  Below is the project overview provided by the professor, Dr. Dunn.
Overview:
The best way to learn about using data science is to actually use it. The purpose of this course project is to give you an opportunity to explore elements of the data science pipeline from start to finish, from data preprocessing, data exploration and visualization, predictive model design and selection, and effective communication of results and interpretation. Even more importantly, this is an opportunity to explore the techniques that we learn in this class on an application that’s interesting to you. The course project will be completed in groups of 3. Your course project should address an interesting and meaningful problem. Inspiration can come from your future career goals, a personal hobby project, ongoing research, etc. The project’s topic is fairly open as long as it pertains to Biomedical Data Science in some way, given that (i) the problem is difficult enough to be interesting (i.e. linear regression doesn’t give you 100% accuracy) and (ii) the problem is feasible (i.e. the data exists and there are relevant methods to address your question). The goal of the initial project proposal is to check that the proposed idea fits these two criteria. Be creative about the problem you want to address; the project should be something that engages you!
